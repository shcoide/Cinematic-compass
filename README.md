# Cinematic-Compass
This project implements a Movie Recommender System using Streamlit, Python, and external APIs. Users can select a movie from a provided list, and the system recommends similar movies based on similarity scores computed using collaborative filtering techniques. Additionally, the system fetches movie posters dynamically from an external API to enhance user experience.\
